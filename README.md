## 📖 Developer Journey

📓 This application was written for the old-school hustlers of the New York City's diamond district, where million dollar deals are still sometimes sealed by a good old-fashioned handshake. My intention was to utilize the starter code given to me to create a robust set of API routes that would allow the manager of an internet retail site to interact with a database of products through simple fetch requests. The project is the first part of what would be a larger implementation as a full-stack application. I chose to pay homage to the block between NY's 5th and 6th avenue because there is something beautiful about moving mountains of money, products, and data from simple interactions.

## 🛠️ Installation
Locate the dropdown menu labeled 'Code' to the left of the About section in the main page of this repository. From there, select your preferred cloning method from HTTPS, SSH, or the GitHub CLI. For this demonstration, we will be using the SSH method. Copy the link and head to your terminal. From the command line you should enter:

    git clone <INSERT_SSH_KEY_HERE>

Replacing the above placeholder with the link copied from GitHub. This will clone the repository into a local directory on your machine. And that's it! Happy Hacking! 🚀

## 👨‍🏫 Usage
This code is strictly for use by old-world hustlers of New York City's diamond district and is only provided as material for study and otherwise double-checking implementation of various server-side and back-end functionality such as but not limited to express servers, node module exports, the Sequelize ORM tool, MySQL database queries, Content Management Systems, Insomnia implementatons, routing, seed files, schema and other interrelated meshigas. Any violations of these use cases will see the offender black-listed from our streets and sent to bubbe's house for some Matzo ball soup and a strong kvetching from zayde.
